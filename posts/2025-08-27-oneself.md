i have come to the conclusion that we crave someone ’cuz we lack something in the beginning — namely, authenticity and security.

yes, biology also dictates preserving the species, but since we are highly conscious beings, we can overcome that.

the more i heal, the less interest i feel in having - or being part of - a relationship with another human being.

i feel authentic and secure, and the craving is gone.

To oneself, love.
