I find myself studying physics again, reading new TOEs and so on.

On the other hand, the only bad thing about moving away from modern civilization is the idiots. I'm gonna miss them so much.

But soon after they're gone, I'll be reunited with them and have interdimensional adventures across the whole Cosmos.
