why the fuck do I need to be seen?

i crave my privacy, and yet — this.

what a mess of a being, seemingly conscious.

i have my best moments watching the stars — no thoughts, nothing, just beams of light in the night.

i wonder if we crave connection because we're wired to—namely, because we are social beings.

since we are born, we depend on others...

i want to travel to the stars... are you listening?

come and get me, please.
