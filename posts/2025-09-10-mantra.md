- **Is the core pure?** _If I run this function twice with the same input, do I always get the same output?_
- **Whereâ€™s the mess?** _Did I push database calls, logging, time, randomness, or IO to the edges (not hidden in the middle)?_
- **Is the state safe?** _Can my data ever end up in an impossible or nonsense shape?_
- **How do errors show up?** _Does the function clearly return success/failure instead of surprising me with crashes or hidden logs?_
- **Small Lego bricks?** _Can I explain this function in one simple sentence, and does it snap together cleanly with others?_
- **Replayable?** _If I record the inputs and events, can I replay them tomorrow and get the same results?_
- **Observable?** _If something breaks, can I see what happened without opening the code (through logs, IDs, or metrics)?_
