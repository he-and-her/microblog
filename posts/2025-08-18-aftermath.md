In the "coming down from the trees" aftermath, we are standing on the bridge of collapse as a civilization.

This A.I. threat is realâ€”not in the Terminator sense, but in the repercussions it has on us, especially on new generations.

And yet, we are still asking the same question... still trying to construct meaning in a meaningless universe.

So why not just put on some bachatas and dance?

Dance, monkeys, dance!
