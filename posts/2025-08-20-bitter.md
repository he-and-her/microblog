I find myself not bitter. I should be bitter, mad, or something.

Instead, I'm just fine. I'm bored. I'm quiet.

And yet... I have a lot to say, to express â€” but silence feels richer.

...

I cut my hair and I'm growing a beard-stache, or at least whatever I can make of it.

I usually go skinhead, but this time I didn't.

Something's off... something's terribly off.
